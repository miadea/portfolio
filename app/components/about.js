          <p>My name is Emma and I am currently a student at Appalachian State
          University. I am studying to get my degree in Commercial Photography.
          I have worked as an assistant wedding photographer for three years and
          plan to become a product photographer. I also enjoy digital painting
          and take commissions when I am able. I have worked as a web designer
          for marketing websites.</p>
