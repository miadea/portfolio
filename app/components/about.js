          <p>My name is Emma and I love photography. I have been taking photos
          with my mom since I was little and she continues to inspire me. I am
          currently studying Commercial Photography at Appalachian State
          University. Every day I learn something new and exciting about the
          craft, and I use the skills I have learned to keep pushing myself.</p>

// <p>I have also learned a lot in the business itself, I worked as an
// assistant wedding photographer for several years. It was wonderful
// to get real experience with clients and the process of making photographs
// that would be remembered for years. Working with web development is
// also fun and challenging. I enjoy designing and implementing various
// layouts, I find it is another art form all in itself.</p>
